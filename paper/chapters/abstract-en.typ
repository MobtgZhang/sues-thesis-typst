#let 英文关键词 = ("thesis", "typst", "template")

This template is a Typst template for the writing of thesis by postgraduate and undergraduate students at Shanghai University of Engineering Science. It aims to use the latest advanced Typst typesetting tools to focus on the content of the thesis writing, rather than spending too much time and effort on customizing and adjusting the format.
This manual is a reference document for the corresponding template, which provides some environments and commands to make the template easier to use. At the same time, it should be noted that users need to have a certain foundation and experience in Typst programming, and at least learn how to use some common packages of Typst, such as adjusting the spacing between fonts or modifying the font size, etc.

For the update address of the LaTeX template for the master's/bachelor's thesis at Shanghai University of Engineering Science, please refer to the #link("https://github.com/mobtgzhang/sues-thesis-typst","Github").
